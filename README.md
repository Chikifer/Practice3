Practice 3
Conclusion
In this practice, I learned how to see my final designed board in 3D using KiCad itself, and, additionally, to use both
the Gerber and Drill files to check the tracks of my PCB in a web page. It was not difficult at all, but for the same 
reason, I believe I didn't do much. The main issue, which is something I wanted to observe, was that I couldn't achieve
to show the components in the board, and I checked the Preferences and the 3D files, and still these didn't show up. 
I can now appreciate how easy is KiCad to design schematics and PCBs, and I hope I could use in projects in the future.
